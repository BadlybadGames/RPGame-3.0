#### 1. Core mechanics/features ####

	Deep class-less character customization where you can get skills from any "class"

	Teamwork survival?


#### 2. Design Goals ####

	* Customization over power/choice matters
		A level 20 item should not have too much higher item over a level 30 item, instead, the higher level ones
		may be more varied/extreme (though some power increase on average is required to not make a player use
		the one really cool weapon he found at level 5 for the whole game)

		You should not be forced between powering up your bread and butter skill over getting a new skill
			how: Possibly have different soorts of skill points (unlock a new skill every second level, a new
				passive every level, "customization upgrade"(like Diablo3 runes) every 3rd level)

		Weapons, and especially weapon types should have fundemental meechanical differences
			i.e. Halberds are very slow and lower mobility/turn rate, but have huge reach and arcs
				To expand on this, possibly have weapons have combos, maybe even several combos on a single
				weapon. For example, a sword could have a stabbing attack, or a combo with 3 slashes.

#### Meta game ideas ####

	Game mode ideas:
		*Linear campaign with slight variances
		*Campaign "spinoff" that is much more random

	Traversing a 2d grid map where you choose what zones to fight in, that have different enemies/obstacles

	Have a sort of base in the middle of the map/on the bottom that you can upgrade?
		The base could affect the "main game" like in elona shooter, possibly be what you have to defend, etc.


#### Enemies ####

	Enemies can have different behaviours that can be manipulated by spells and effects
		Some enemies may be aggressive/suicidal, making them less likely to hide when low on life

		Have an intelligence attribute that affects how likely AI is to choose smart results
			For example, low intelligence may make an enemy more likely to be fooled by an illusion, or
			make it unable to find the way when the path is too complex, or choose to focus on a tanky target
			instead of a squishy one.
				+This makes cannon fodder enemies less computing heavy

		Reflex parameter that affects how quick enemies are to react

	Enemy mutations, pretty much suffix/affix mod system
		For example, there could be a "Brawny" mutation that would give the enemy more hp and larger size, but
		also decrease its intelligence, and increase its suicidal behaviour parameter

#### Misc ideas ####

	Class/skill ideas:
		Hipstermancy - Fireballs are too main stream, use firecubes instead.

		Spells that manipulate the map, like putting a stone wall to block

	Spell combination
		Projectile with AoE damage on arrival + DoT that spreads on death -> DoT that explodes and spreads
		on death

	Time manipulation spells

	Item crafting, weapons have components, you can mix and match components to create sort of new weapons,
	salvage old items to get their components etc.

	Race selection on birth that have some special attributes

	Mutations DCCS style, possibly for a race? a class? general system?


#### Misc design notes ####

	Pure buffs = bad! Boring buffs = bad!
		Bad: "Activate to give you and your allies 10% damage reduction for 100 minutes. 20 sec cooldown"
			Active skills that are activate and forget/you press one time every 10 minutes because you have to are in general bad. Should be psasive instead
		Better: "Activate to give nearby allies 20% movementspeed and 30% damage reduction for 10 seconds. 30 sec cooldown"
			Noticable effects are better than statistical effects, and this version requires management and possibly cooperation
		Also good: "<do some sort of interesting attack to enemies>, if this attack hits, you and your allies temporarily recieve some bonus"
