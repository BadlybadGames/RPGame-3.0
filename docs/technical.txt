### Collision ###

There are 3 different collision systems controlling entities:

1) A collision manager manages collisions between world entities (projectiles, enemies, the player) and their targetting
(Player's projectile hits enemy, but not other projectiles or the player)

2) Tile collision makes sure characters don't walk through solid obstacles

3) Pathfinding that can be invoked by AI and others
